            Calculating your due date is one of the first steps in pregnancy
            planning. While only about 5% of babies are born on their exact due
            date, having an accurate estimate helps you and your healthcare
            provider plan for your pregnancy journey.

            <div>
              <h3>Why do doctors add 40 weeks from LMP?</h3>
              <p>
                This accounts for the typical 2 weeks before ovulation plus 38
                weeks of pregnancy.

              <h3>What if I have irregular periods?</h3>
              <p>
                An early ultrasound will provide the most accurate due date.
