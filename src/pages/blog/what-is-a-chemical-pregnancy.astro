          <p class="lead">
            A <strong>chemical pregnancy</strong> is an early miscarriage that occurs
            before the fifth week of pregnancy. It happens when a fertilized egg
            implants in the uterus but does not develop properly. This results in
            a very early loss, often before a woman even realizes she is pregnant.

          </h3>
          <p>
            A <strong>clinical pregnancy</strong> is confirmed by an ultrasound showing
            a gestational sac and fetal heartbeat, while a <strong

          <h2 id="symptoms">What Are the Symptoms of a Chemical Pregnancy?</h2>
          <p>
            Many women do not notice a chemical pregnancy because it happens so
            early. However, common signs include:

            At around 4 weeks, symptoms might include light bleeding, mild

            breasts or nausea.

          <h2 id="causes">Causes & Risk Factors of Chemical Pregnancy</h2>
          <p>
            A chemical pregnancy is usually caused by chromosomal abnormalities
            in the fertilized egg. Other risk factors include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Age</strong> (higher risk for women over 35)</li>
            <li><strong>Hormonal imbalances</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Thyroid disorders</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Uncontrolled diabetes</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Uterine abnormalities</strong></li>
            <li>
              <strong>Lifestyle factors</strong> (smoking, excessive alcohol, or
              stress)
            </li>

              </h3>
              <p>
                A chemical pregnancy is often detected when a woman gets a <strong

                Blood hCG Test
              </h3>
              <p>
                Doctors check <strong>hCG levels</strong>, which rise in early
                pregnancy. If they drop instead of increasing, it indicates a
                chemical pregnancy.

                Ultrasound
              </h3>
              <p>
                Since a chemical pregnancy happens so early, an ultrasound
                usually does not detect a gestational sac.

          <p>
            A chemical pregnancy can be confusing and emotionally challenging.
            While it occurs early, it is still a pregnancy loss. Tracking
            ovulation and pregnancy through a reliable <a
              href="/calculators/pregnancy">pregnancy calculator</a
            > can provide better insights into future pregnancies. If you experience
            repeated early miscarriages, consult a healthcare provider to explore
            potential underlying causes.
