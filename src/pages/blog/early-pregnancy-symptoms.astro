            pregnancy sooner and begin appropriate prenatal care.

          <h2 id="when-test">When Should You Take a Pregnancy Test?</h2>
          <p>
            For most accurate results, wait until after your missed period to
            take a home pregnancy test. However, some tests can detect pregnancy
            a few days before a missed period.

            <div>
              <h3>Can you have pregnancy symptoms before a positive test?</h3>
              <p>
                Yes, some women experience symptoms before there's enough hCG
                for a positive test.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h3>Are pregnancy symptoms the same for everyone?</h3>
              <p>
                No, symptoms vary greatly between individuals and even between
                pregnancies.
              </p>

            <div>
              <h3>How accurate are early pregnancy symptoms?</h3>
              <p>
                Many early pregnancy symptoms can mimic PMS, so a pregnancy test
                is the best way to confirm.

          <h2 id="conclusion">Final Thoughts</h2>
          <p>
            Early pregnancy symptoms can vary greatly from person to person.
            While these signs can indicate pregnancy, the only way to be sure is
            through a pregnancy test and medical confirmation. Use our <a
