        <h2 id="what-is-ibw">What is Ideal Body Weight?</h2>
        <p>
          Ideal Body Weight (IBW) is an estimated weight range considered
          healthy for your height, age, and body frame. However, it's important
          to note that "ideal" varies significantly between individuals.
        </p>

        <h2 id="calculation-methods">Common Calculation Methods</h2>
        <h3 id="hamwi-formula">Hamwi Formula</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>For men: 48.0 kg + 2.7 kg per inch over 5 feet</li>
          <li>For women: 45.5 kg + 2.2 kg per inch over 5 feet</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="divine-formula">Divine Formula</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>For men: 50.0 kg + 2.3 kg per inch over 5 feet</li>
          <li>For women: 45.5 kg + 2.3 kg per inch over 5 feet</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="factors">Factors Affecting Ideal Weight</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Body frame size</li>
          <li>Muscle mass</li>
          <li>Age</li>
          <li>Gender</li>
          <li>Overall health status</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="healthy-range">Understanding Healthy Weight Range</h2>
        <p>
          Rather than focusing on a single "ideal" number, it's better to
          consider a healthy weight range that accounts for your individual
          factors and body composition.
        </p>

        <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          While ideal body weight calculations can provide a useful reference
          point, they shouldn't be considered absolute targets. Focus on overall
          health, body composition, and consult with healthcare professionals
          for personalized guidance.
