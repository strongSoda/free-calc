        <h2 id="what-is-bmi">What is BMI (Body Mass Index)?</h2>
        <p>
          Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple measurement that uses your height
          and weight to work out if your weight is healthy. It's widely used by
          healthcare professionals as a quick screening tool to categorize
          weight status.
        </p>

        <h2 id="bmi-calculation">How is BMI Calculated?</h2>
        <p>
          BMI is calculated by dividing your weight in kilograms by your height
          in meters squared:
        </p>
        <div
          class="bg-surface-light-hover dark:bg-surface-dark p-4 rounded-lg font-mono"
        >
          BMI = weight (kg) / height² (m²)
        </div>

        <h2 id="bmi-categories">BMI Categories</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Underweight</strong>: BMI less than 18.5
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Normal weight</strong>: BMI 18.5 to 24.9
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Overweight</strong>: BMI 25 to 29.9
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Obese</strong>: BMI 30 or greater
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="bmi-limitations">Limitations of BMI</h2>
        <p>
          While BMI is useful as a quick screening tool, it has several
          important limitations:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Doesn't account for muscle mass</li>
          <li>Doesn't consider body fat distribution</li>
          <li>May not be suitable for athletes</li>
          <li>Different thresholds may apply to different ethnicities</li>
          <li>Not accurate for pregnant women or elderly</li>
        </ul>

        </div>

        <h2 id="alternatives">Alternative Measurements</h2>
        <p>
          Due to BMI's limitations, consider using these additional
          measurements:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Body Fat Percentage</li>
          <li>Waist Circumference</li>
          <li>Waist-to-Hip Ratio</li>
          <li>Body Composition Analysis</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          While BMI is a useful screening tool, it should not be the only
          measure used to assess health and body composition. Consider using it
          alongside other measurements and always consult healthcare
          professionals for personalized advice.
