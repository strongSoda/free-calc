    <h2>Understanding Your Mortgage Calculator Results</h2>
    <p>
      Our mortgage calculator helps you estimate your monthly mortgage payments
      and understand the full cost of homeownership. Here's what each component
      means:
    </p>

    <h3>Monthly Payment Components</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Principal and Interest:</strong> The base monthly payment that goes
        toward paying off your loan.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Property Taxes:</strong> Annual property taxes divided into monthly
        payments.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Home Insurance:</strong> Your annual homeowner's insurance premium
        divided into monthly payments.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>PMI (Private Mortgage Insurance):</strong> Required if your down
        payment is less than 20% of the home price.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>HOA Fees:</strong> Monthly homeowners association fees, if applicable.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Understanding Amortization</h3>
    <p>
      The amortization schedule shows how your loan balance decreases over time.
      In the early years, a larger portion of your payment goes toward interest.
      As time progresses, more of each payment goes toward reducing the
      principal balance.
    </p>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <h3>How is my monthly mortgage payment calculated?</h3>
    <p>Your monthly mortgage payment is calculated using several factors:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Principal loan amount</li>
      <li>Interest rate</li>
      <li>Loan term (usually 15 or 30 years)</li>
      <li>Property taxes</li>
      <li>Home insurance</li>
      <li>Private Mortgage Insurance (if applicable)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What is PMI and when is it required?</h3>
    <p>
      Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI) is typically required when your down
      payment is less than 20% of the home's purchase price. PMI protects the
      lender if you default on your loan. Once you build up 20% equity in your
      home, you may be able to remove PMI.
    </p>

    <h3>How can I lower my monthly mortgage payment?</h3>
    <p>There are several ways to lower your monthly mortgage payment:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Make a larger down payment</li>
      <li>Extend the loan term (though this increases total interest paid)</li>
      <li>Find a lower interest rate</li>
      <li>Buy a less expensive home</li>
      <li>Avoid PMI by putting 20% down</li>
      <li>Shop around for better property insurance rates</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Making Extra Payments</h2>
    <p>
      Making extra payments can significantly reduce your loan term and total
      interest paid. Even small additional monthly payments can make a big
      difference over time. Use our calculator to see how extra payments affect
      your amortization schedule.
